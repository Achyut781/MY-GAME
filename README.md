How do you plan to make your game engaging? 
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________


This game will be engaging as the players will bite their nails to make sure humans aren’t extinct and will try their best to win specially when they are the brave soldier themselves. Players can play this game again and again by the reset button. After they reach score 5, the frost giant will come really fast and in every direction. So… enjoy my game!
